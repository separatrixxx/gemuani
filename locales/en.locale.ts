		text21: "The caravanserai building (shopping areas, warehouses and an inn for merchants) with a theater was built in 1851 by order of Prince Mikhail Vorontsov with money from the merchant G.I. Tamamshev. The laying of the foundation took place on April 15, 1847 - on the site of a recently filled-in ravine, on Erivan Square. The building was built according to a joint project by Italian architect Giovani Scudieri and Grigory Gagarin. The building was one of the examples of early eclecticism in Tiflis: the facade of the building belonged to “Italian architecture”: the architect used the motifs of the basilica of the architect Andria Paladio in the city of Vincenza; Oriental (Iranian) motifs were used in the interior. For the theater room, the type of tiered theater with a deep stage—a box—was chosen. The theater accommodated 700 people and was the largest theater building in Transcaucasia. In addition, the building contained 266 retail spaces and warehouses.",
		text22: "The grand opening of the theater took place on November 8, 1851 with Donizetti's opera Lucia di Lammermoor. For the second season in 1852, a Russian ballet troupe from St. Petersburg was invited to the Tiflis Theater; Since 1854, ballet performances became regular (Gitana by I. F. Schmidt, choreographer F. N. Manokhin), ballets by P. I. Tchaikovsky, A. K. Glazunov, A. Adam and others were staged.",
		text23: "After the fire, the caravanserai was restored, but without the theater. Construction of the new opera house building began in 1880, on Golovinsky Prospekt. The author of the project, architect V. A. Schröter, chose a pseudo-Moorish style. The construction was supervised at different times by P. Stern, A. Zaltsman and A. Shimkevich. The construction of the new theater building cost 750 thousand rubles in gold and most of this amount was allocated from the state treasury, which is why the theater was called “Kazenny”.",
